            <ul>
                <li>Personal Background : Born and raised in CLT! I love the car scene, I love tech, I procrastinate.
                </li>
                <li>Professional Background: No pro background in this scene, but ive worked at restaurants for the past
                    3-4
                    years and reached a ‘shift leader’ position at one point.
                </li>
                <li>Academic Background: Graduated High School, now working on my degree here at UNCC with a
                    concentration
                    in cyber security… hopefully
                </li>
                <li>Background in this Subject: i took itis 1213, 2214, that's it.</li>
                <li>Primary Computer Platform: 2020 Macbook Air</li>
                <li class="bold"> Courses I'm Taking & Why</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>LBST 2301 - Critical Thinking and Communications: Applied Engineering Ethics - I chose this
                        course
                        because I believe that being able to critically think and effectively communicate with others in
                        any
                        space is super important. Also applying ethics in a field like this, with tech only advancing
                        with
                        time, will become a staple and a hot topic in the future.</li>
                    <li>Math 1242 - Calculus II: man this was required. I hate it. </li>

                    <li>LBST 2214 - Health and quality of life: I had to take two LBST’s before they were removed or
                        something like that, I forgot.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by: don't ask me about any assignment, i probably haven't even
                    looked at it tbh. Yes its a problem. </li>
                <li>I'd also like to Share: im working on my procrastination, i promise… Also I play rocket league, i
                    barely
                    made it to champ.</li>
