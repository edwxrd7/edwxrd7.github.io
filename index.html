      <p>
        Hey! my name is Edward, and I am a sophmore at UNCC! My passion for coding and things computer science were birthed my senior year of highschool. Coming into college I knew nothing at all, and was hesitant to even persue a carrer in a field I knew nothing about, but was willing to learn. Since then ive had nothing but fun so far, but that does not mean it wasnt challenging.
